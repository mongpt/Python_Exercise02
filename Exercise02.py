
# Phase 1: Write a program that asks your name and then greets you by your name

# Phase 5: Write a program that asks the user to enter a mass in medieval units:
# talents (leivisk√§), pounds (naula), and lots (luoti).
# The program converts the input to full kilograms and grams and outputs the result to the user
talent = float(input("Enter talents: "))

# Phase 6: Write a program that draws two random combinations of numbers for a combination lock:
